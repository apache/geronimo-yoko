= Using the Bus across Threads and Sub Processes

== SimpleBus
SimpleBus is the simple base interface for the bus that most processes that use the bus are based on.

|===
|Return Type |Method Name |Parameters |Description

|SimpleBus
|put
|(String key, String value)
|This is similar to how put works on a Map. It puts a value on the bus for the matching key. After it has been put on the bus other threads and processes can access the value.

|String
|get
|(String key)
|Allows a thread or process to wait for a value to be put on the bus that matches the inputted key. Once it arrives on the bus the value is returned.

|SimpleBus
|onMsg
|(String key, Consumer<String> action)
|Performs the action inputted as a parameter once the value matching the inputted key arrives on the bus. You would use `onMsg` over `get` when you want to do something asynchronous with a value from the bus.

|boolean
|hasKey
|(String key)
|Returns true if the key inputted currently has a value on the bus.

|Bus
|forUser
|(String user)
|This is used if you only want a specific user to look at the value placed on the bus.

|String
|peek
|(String key)
|It returns the value from the key inputted if it currently exists on the bus. If there is no value then null is returned. Unlike `get` it does not wait for a value to be put on the bus.

== UserBus
UserBus has a similar interface to SimpleBus The main difference is that on the UserBus, the message you put and get from the bus is specific to a particular user. Within the UserBus interface, there is a `String user()` method which returns the name given to the user of the bus.

== EventBus
EventBus is a more generic version of the SimpleBus, allowing us to no longer be restricted to just using strings on the bus. Oher then having a generic object type for the method, the rest of the interface is the same as SimpleBus. It also improves the SimpleBus by allowing you to have type safe key-value pairs.
